<h1 class="blue-title">Network Security</h1>

<p><strong>Network security</strong> is a crucial field that focuses on understanding and defending against attacks on computer networks. This includes learning how attackers operate and how to design systems that are resistant to these threats.</p>

<h2 style="color:darkgreen;">Network Security</h2>

<ul>
    <li><em>How bad guys attack computer networks</em></li>
    <li><em>How we can defend networks against attacks</em></li>
    <li><em>How to design architectures that are immune to attacks</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The Internet was not originally built with strong security in mind. It was designed for <em>"a group of mutually trusting users attached to a transparent network."</em> Today, protocol designers are constantly working to catch up, considering security in all layers of the network!</p>

        <h2 style="color:darkblue;">Malware</h2>
        <p><strong>Bad Guys: Malware</strong> can infect hosts in several ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Virus:</strong> A self-replicating infection that spreads by executing objects (like email attachments).</li>
            <li><strong>Worm:</strong> A self-replicating infection that passively receives and executes objects.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Additionally, <strong>spyware</strong> malware can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Record keystrokes</li>
            <li>Track websites visited</li>
            <li>Upload stolen data to a collection site</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Infected hosts may become part of a <strong>botnet</strong>, used for sending spam or launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.</p>

        <h2 style="color:darkblue;">Bad Guys: Denial of Service (DoS)</h2>
        <p><strong>Denial of Service (DoS)</strong> attacks overwhelm a server or network resource with fake traffic, making it unavailable for legitimate users.</p>
        <p>The attack steps are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select a target</li>
            <li>Break into hosts around the network (botnets)</li>
            <li>Send massive amounts of packets from compromised hosts</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 style="color:purple;">Bad Guys: Packet Interception</h2>
        <p>Using <strong>packet sniffing</strong>, attackers can intercept network traffic and capture sensitive information like passwords. This happens especially in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Broadcast media (shared Ethernet, wireless networks)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A <em>promiscuous network interface</em> can read all passing packets. A popular tool for packet sniffing is <strong>Wireshark</strong>.</p>

        <h2 style="color:brown;">Bad Guys: Fake Identity (IP Spoofing)</h2>
        <p><strong>IP spoofing</strong> involves sending packets with a false source address to disguise the attacker’s identity.</p>
